In 2015, Biilmann invited Christian Bach, his childhood friend who was working as an executive at a creative services agency in Denmark, to join him as co-founder in his new venture. In 2017, MakerLoop was rebranded as Netlify.</p>\n<p>Beyond the initial focus on hosting for static websites, and attracting many developers with a free basic offer, the company expanded to a broader offering including serverless functions and test and deployment services.</p>\n<h3>Products</h3>\n<h6>Netlify CMS</h6>\n<p>To address some of the limitations of static websites, which tend to be less sophisticated and harder to use for the website maintainer than a dynamic content publishing solution such as WordPress or Medium, Netlify develops its own open source headless content management system called Netlify CMS.</p>\n<h6>Jamstack</h6>\n<p>Jamstack is a cloud-native web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript code, reusable APIs, and markup content. It was pioneered and created by Netlify. In its purest form, the idea of Jamstack is that a web application is pre-built into static pages, using content and code to generate the output. In basic terms, Jamstack is a significant shift in focus from the now abstractable back end to the now-powerful front end.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 04, 2021","title":"Netlify-the hosting platform","description":"Netlify is a San Francisco-based cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites.","tags":["netlify","cms","jamstack"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2b86c7dc-0dc8-5476-98ce-4338d045617d"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4080856488"]}
