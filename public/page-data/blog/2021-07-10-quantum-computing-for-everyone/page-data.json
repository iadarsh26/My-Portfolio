Expansion is expected in the next few years as the field shifts toward real-world use in pharmaceutical, data security and other applications.</p>\n<h2>A little history</h2>\n<p>Quantum computing began in 1980 when physicist Paul Benioff proposed a quantum mechanical model of the Turing machine.</p>\n<p>Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin later suggested that a quantum computer had the potential to simulate things a classical computer could not feasibly do.</p>\n<p>On 23 October 2019, Google AI, in partnership with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), claimed to have performed a quantum computation that was infeasible on any classical computer.</p>\n<h2>Quantum algorithms</h2>\n<p>Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.</p>\n<p>Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms, solving Pell's equation, and more generally solving the hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups. These algorithms depend on the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform. No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely. Certain oracle problems like Simon's problem and the Bernstein–Vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model, which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove, and doesn't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.</p>\n<p>Some quantum algorithms, like Grover's algorithm and amplitude amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms. Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are related to Grover's algorithm, including Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one functions, which uses Grover's algorithm, and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees, which is a variant of the search problem.</p>\n<h3>Potential applications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cryptography</li>\n<li>Search problems</li>\n<li>Machine learning</li>\n<li>Computational biology</li>\n<li>Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimization</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 10, 2021","title":"Quantum Computing for everyone","description":"Quantum computing is the exploitation of collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computation.
