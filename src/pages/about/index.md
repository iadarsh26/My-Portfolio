Hi, I'am Adarsh Singh.

I am from Nagpur, Maharashtra. I am pursuing my BE from Trinity college of Engineering and Research, Pune in Information Technology.

I have completed my Diploma from Government Polytechnic Yavatmal.

My technical skill set includes:- Python, Java, HTML, CSS, php, javascript, DBMS, also I've worked on Linux, Anaconda, Xampp.

I am a quick learner and has been working on my programming skills and upgrading them.

I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.
